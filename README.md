# What
Checks the UTD Prague study abroad page to see if the application is open yet. If the application is open, it will send an email to myself

# Why
To hopefully get a spot on the study abroad trip if I apply early enough

# How
Uses selenium to check if the webpage says the application is closed every 60 seconds

If it's closed, it sends an email from myself to myself

first line in secrets.txt is my email

second line is destination email

third line the authentication password
